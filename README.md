## ⚖️ Bias Audit Report  
*Evaluating fairness, transparency, and potential bias in machine learning models.*

---

### 🧠 **Overview**
This project focuses on auditing machine learning models for **bias, fairness, and ethical concerns**.  
Using industry-standard fairness tools, the audit provides insights into how a model performs across different groups, helping ensure responsible and equitable AI development.
